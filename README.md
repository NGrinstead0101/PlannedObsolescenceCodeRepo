# PlannedObsolescenceCodeRepo

Hello, my name is Nick Grinstead! Planned Obsolescence is a prototype for a card game about repairing robots created as a group project for a prototyping course. This repository holds the scripts from Planned Obsolescence that I wrote for this project. In particular, I coded various "states" of gameplay and the random generation code for creating robots. A few of these scripts were added to by Thomas Revord in order to integrate them with other systems in the prototype.
