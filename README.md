# PlannedObsolescenceCodeRepo

Hello, my name is Nick Grinstead! Planned Obsolescence is prototype for a card game about repairing robots created as a group project for a prototyping course. This repository holds the scripts from Planned Obsolescence that I wrote for this project. In particular I coded various "states" of gameplay and the random generation code for creating robots. Some of these scripts were added to by Thomas Revord in order to integrate them with other systems in the prototype.
